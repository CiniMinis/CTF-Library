# CTF-Libray
CTF-Libray (CTF-lib) is a python library for easily creating CTF, jeopardy style challenges.

## Installation
So far the project isn't in the python package manager [pip].

To install, download the py/pyc files from GitHub and import them into your project manually.

## Usage
The test_server.py file shows an example of general usage of the library.
For further questions, feel free to contact me (CiniMinis).

## Future Plans
 - [x] Add stats to ctf servers
 - [ ] Further abstract socket usage in challenge functions
 - [ ] Simplify new shell functions
 - [ ] Add support for a website front instead of the shell
